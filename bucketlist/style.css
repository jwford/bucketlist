/* Note to self: will need a separate css file for the homepage and a separate one for the other pages,
if we make the homepage be a closed book. Unless we just do a pad of paper or something.
The image will have to be changed, if that's what we're using as the background & then basing
the html off of that, but that could cause problems with making the browser smaller. -MH */
