    <h2>What are bucket lists?<h2>
  </div>
  <div id="discover_text" class="discover_tabs">
    <p class="distext">Derived from the euphemism "kicking the bucket," a bucket list is a compilation of things a person wants to do before he or she dies. In general, these lists consist of places to travel to and feats to accomplish before a person's passing. The creation of a bucket list can be justified by Dr. Daniel Kahneman's peak-end theory; people judge an event or experience based on "how we perform at the peak (the most intense point) and at the end of the experience or event." An experience can be deemed to be pleasant or unpleasant from those high/low points instead of the overall experience. In other words, we remember the high points and low points of an experience as well as what happens most recently and make judgments based on our feelings at these points. We often ignore what occurs in between. For example, how many times have you heard adults talk about their "glory days" back in college or high school? They probably remember the crazy events that occurred on campus or a grade on a really challenging paper, but they won't remember their daily feelings during the school year. </p>
    <p class="distext">The peak-end theory helps explain why people make bucket lists. According to the theory, people who carry out the items on their lists will remember their moments of extreme happiness, their depressed moments, and their most recent experiences. Bucket lists can help provide a person with specific goals, which can later become their "peak" events. For example, prior to her death on November 1, Brittany Maynard, a 29-year old woman diagnosed with stage 4 glioblastoma, fulfilled her dream of visiting the Grand Canyon. She also visited Alaska, British Columbia, and Yellowstone National Park. When Maynard was diagnosed, she was told she had six months to live, so during that time, she wanted to explore places she had never been. Traveling to those places provided her with experiences that were "peak" events and were close to the end of her life. When she reflected upon her life, she recounted moments from these trips and from other trips she had taken. Maynard's experiences and memories are representative of the peak-end theory. Maynard was able to have a meaningful life, though it was unfortunately a short one, because she created her own call to action: travel the world, donate time to those in need, and spread a message that could change people's lives.</p>
    <p>What is your call to action? What do you feel passionate about? Now is the time to get started on your mission, whatever that may be. Create your list, fill it with all of the adventures you'd like to go on, and begin your journey!

    <h2>What should I put in my list?</h2>
  </div>
  <div id="discover_list" class="discover_tabs">
    <p>Have you ever wanted to travel to a far-away, exotic place? Have you dreamed of climbing the tallest mountain in the world or sky-diving? Have you wondered what it would feel like to complete a marathon or solve a Rubix cube? All of the above are examples of items you can add to your list! However, the items on your list do not need to be as adventurous as those previously stated. "Getting married," "being a better sister," and "mentoring someone" are great additions to your list as well!</p>
    <p>When most people think of a bucket list, they think of activities or accomplishments that they would like to do or achieve before their passing. However, in the New York Times article, "The Moral Bucket List," author David Brooks brings to light the idea that people should strive to satisfy their moral desires as well as their career goals. For example, a person could add "being more humble" or "being more confident in myself" to his or her list.</p>
    <p>If you are still stuck, here are a few more examples of adventures to put on your list:
      <ul>
        <li>Climb the Eiffel Tower
        <li>Ski the Alps
        <li>Watch a meteor shower
        <li>Visit the Grand Canyon
        <li>Learn how to play guitar
        <li>Learn a second language
        <li>Mentor someone
      </ul>

    <h2>What contributes to a meaningful life?</h2>
  </div>
  <div id="discover_theory" class="discover_tabs">
    <p>According to many researchers, in order to have a meaningful life, people first need to determine what they care deeply about, and from there, they can work in whatever way they choose to either achieve or attempt to achieve their goal.</p>
    <p>Morrie Schwartz, a late professor at Brandeis University, successfully describes how to have a meaningful life. In the book <u>Tuesdays with Morrie</u>, Mitch Albom, one of Morrie's former students, learns of his mentor's ALS diagnosis and decides to visit his beloved professor, though the two had lost touch years before. <u>Tuesdays with Morrie</u> presents its readers with an atypical sort of bucket list: Mitch creates a list of topics to talk about with Morrie before Morrie passes. Although Morrie had not intentionally developed a list of things to accomplish before he died, he explains why he can approach his inevitable ending in a peaceful, resolved, and yet still emotional way. Morrie gives Mitch advice on how to live a meaningful life: "Devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning." Prior to his death, Morrie feels as if his life was meaningful because he had worked for causes of importance to him. Though Morrie never physically wrote down a list, he explains his moral bucket list to Mitch retrospectively. Morrie had created and responded in full to his own call to action, and he helps Mitch recognize his. Morrie believes that Mitch's true call to action is his storytelling, but not in the way that Mitch had been doing it; Mitch worked as a sports writer and he had been "pursing these very things [Morrie] had been railing against- bigger toys, nicer house." After speaking with Morrie, Mitch begins to rethink the direction of his life, and ultimately decides to publish the lessons that Morrie had shared with him in this book. Mitch was able to create meaning in his life because, with a little help from his dying professor, he was able to refocus and determine what his priorities were. His call to action was to tell stories with a purpose, and he has accomplished just that.</p>
    <p>Similarly, in his famous "Last Lecture," the late Carnegie Mellon University computer science professor, Randy Pausch, says, "it's important to have specific dreams." He argues that both achieving those dreams and failing to achieve them contribute to a meaningful life, which is consistent with the idea that a person must at least attempt to respond to his or her call to action. Pasuch details many of his own dreams and how he accomplished (or failed to accomplish) them during his lifetime. He tells of certain people who help us achieve our goals and that we should learn from them. Pausch urges his audience to "never lose the childlike wonder" because it is "what drives us." He claims that we should be persistent and never give up on something we want or believe in. Pausch's arguments are similar to those of Morrie: to have a meaningful life, we must have dreams, whether they are selfish or altruistic, and we must try to accomplish them, even if we stumble along the way.</p>
