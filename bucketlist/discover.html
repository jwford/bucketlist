    <h2>What are bucket lists?<h2>
  </div>
  <div id="discover_text" class="discover_tabs">
    <p class="distext">Derived from the euphemism "kicking the bucket," a bucket list is a compilation of things a person wants to do before he or she dies. In general, these lists consist of places to visit and feats to accomplish during a person's life. Dr. Daniel Kahneman's peak-end theory justifies the creation of a bucket list; people judge an event or experience based on "how we perform at the peak (the most intense point) and at the end of the experience or event." An experience is typically considered pleasant or unpleasant depending on how we feel at these high or low points, instead of remembering the entire event. Thus, it is important to document these moments so people can anticipate their "peak" experiences and relive them afterwards. </p>
    <p class="distext">The peak-end theory explains why people make bucket lists, citing that people who accomplish the items on their lists remember their moments of happiness and sadness, as well as their most recent experiences. Bucket lists provide a person with specific goals, which later become their "peak" events. For instance, prior to her death, Brittany Maynard, a 29-year-old woman diagnosed with stage 4 glioblastoma and given only six months to live, fulfilled her dreams of visiting the Grand Canyon, Alaska, British Columbia, and Yellowstone National Park. These "peak" experiences became her most memorable moments and provided happiness in her last months, proving that completing your goals in life can be rewarding: a pillr of the peak-end theory.</p>
    <p>What is your call to action? What do you feel passionate about? Now is the time to get started on your mission, whatever that may be. Fill your bucket list with your the adventures you hope to accomplish, and begin your journey!

    <h2>What should I put in my list?</h2>
  </div>
  <div id="discover_list" class="discover_tabs">
    <p>Have you ever wanted to travel to a far-away, exotic place? Have you dreamed of climbing the tallest mountain in the world or sky-diving? Have you wondered how it would feel to complete a marathon or to solve a Rubix cube? All of these examples are items you can add to your list! However, these items do not need to be extreme or highly adventurous. Goals like "Getting married," "being a better sister," and "mentoring someone" are great additions to your list as well!</p>
    <p>When most people think of a bucket list, they think of activities or accomplishments that they would like to do or achieve before their passing. However, in the New York Times article, "The Moral Bucket List," author David Brooks brings to light the idea that people should strive to satisfy their moral desires as well as their career goals. For example, a person could add "being more humble" or "being more confident in myself" to his or her list.</p>
    <p>If you are still stuck, here are a few more examples of adventures to put on your list:
      <ul>
        <li>Climb the Eiffel Tower
        <li>Ski the Alps
        <li>Watch a meteor shower
        <li>Visit the Grand Canyon
        <li>Learn how to play guitar
        <li>Learn a second language
      </ul>

    <h2>What contributes to a meaningful life?</h2>
  </div>
  <div id="discover_theory" class="discover_tabs">
    <p>According to many researchers, in order to have a meaningful life, people need to determine what they care deeply about. Then, they can work achieve their goals.</p>
    <p>Morrie Schwartz, a late professor at Brandeis University, successfully describes how to have a meaningful life. In the book <u>Tuesdays with Morrie</u>, Mitch Albom, one of Morrie's former students, learns of his mentor's ALS diagnosis and decides to visit his beloved professor, though the two lost touch years before. <u>Tuesdays with Morrie</u> presents its readers with an unusual sort of bucket list: Mitch creates a list of topics to talk about with Morrie before Morrie passes. Although Morrie unintentionally developed a list of things to accomplish before he died, he explains why he approaches his inevitable ending in a peaceful and resolved way. Morrie gives Mitch advice on how to live a meaningful life: "Devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning." Prior to his death, Morrie thinks he led a meaningful life because he accomplished the important items on his bucket list. Morrie believes that Mitch's true call to action is his storytelling, but not in the way that Mitch had been doing it; Mitch worked as a sports writer and he had been "pursing these very things [Morrie] had been railing against- bigger toys, nicer house." After speaking with Morrie, Mitch begins to rethink the direction of his life, and ultimately decides to publish the lessons that Morrie shared with him in this book. Mitch created meaning in his life because, with a little help from his dying professor, he determined his priorities and told stories with purpose.</p>
    <p>Similarly, in his famous "Last Lecture," the late Carnegie Mellon University computer science professor, Randy Pausch, says, "it's important to have specific dreams." He argues that both achieving and failing to achieve dreams contribute to a meaningful life because a person still responds to their call to action. Pausch details his own dreams and how he accomplished or failed to accomplish them during his lifetime. He explains that certain people help others achieve their goals, providing a learning experience. People should never give up on what they believe in. Pausch's arguments are similar to those of Morrie: have a meaningful life, document dreams, and try to accomplish them.</p>
