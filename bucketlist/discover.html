  <div id="discover_text">
    <p>What is a bucket list? Derived from the euphemism "kicking the bucket," a bucket list is a compilation of things a person wants to do before he or she dies. In general, these lists consist of places to travel to and feats to accomplish before a person's passing. The creation of a bucket list can be justified by Dr. Daniel Kahneman's peak-end theory; people judge an event or experience based on "how we perform at the peak (the most intense point) and at the end of the experience or event." An experience can be deemed to be pleasant or unpleasant from those high/low points instead of the overall experience. In other words, we remember the high points and low points of an experience as well as what happens most recently and make judgments based on these events. We often ignore what occurs in between. For example, how many times have you heard adults talk about their "glory days" back in college or high school? They probably remember the crazy events that occurred on campus or a grade on a really challenging paper, but they won't remember their daily feelings during the school year. </p>

    <p>The peak-end theory helps explain why people make bucket lists. According to the theory, people who carry out the items on their lists will remember their moments of extreme happiness, their depressed moments, and their most recent experiences. Bucket lists can help provide a person with specific goals, which can later become their "peak" events. For example, prior to her death on November 1, Brittany Maynard, a 29-year old woman diagnosed with stage 4 glioblastoma, fulfilled her dream of visiting the Grand Canyon. She also visited Alaska, British Columbia, and Yellowstone National Park. When Maynard was diagnosed, she was told she had six months to live, so during that time, she wanted to explore places she had never been. Traveling to those places provided her with experiences that were "peak" events and were close to the end of her life. When she reflected upon her life, she recounted moments from these trips and from other trips she had taken. Maynard's experiences and memories are representative of the peak-end theory. Maynard was able to have a meaningful life, though it was unfortunately a short one, because she created her own call to action: travel the world, donate time to those in need, and spread a message that could change people's lives.</p>
